- Embedd multiple interactive "scenes" directly in your React based site.
- Uses a redux-like state cycle
- Defined method of extention via Entities and Systems.

### Supports
- Imported Meshes
- Materials with Textures
- Muliple forms of camera and light sources
- Basic Animations
- Gravity
- Collisions
- Particles
- Basic triggers like onClick
- Add things like overlays with React generated DOM
- Lot's more to come!

## Example

A basic example of Akkad can be created in one file:

```
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Akkad, Scene, cameras, lights, shapes} from "akkad";

const {ArcRotateCamera} = cameras;
const {HemisphericLight} = lights;
const {Box} = shapes;

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <Akkad>
                <Scene>
                    <ArcRotateCamera
                        initialPosition={[3, 4, -5]}
                        target={[0, 1, 0]}
                    />
                    <HemisphericLight />
                    <Box />
                </Scene>
            </Akkad>
        );
    }
}

export default App;
```

Please check out the example project included for more.


### Development

Akkad includes an example project for quick testing and development work. To use the example project:

From the project root:
```
$ cd akkad
$ npm run setup:watch
$ cd ../example
$ npm run setup:dev
$ npm run start:dev
```

This will allow you to make changes to Akkad live while you are running the example app.
